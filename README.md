# ðŸ“œ Development cheatsheets

This repos holds ready-to-print cheatsheets for developing (web) applications. They're filled with information I've collected on my learning path, including

- Best practices from the www
- Recommendations by fellow developers and project managers
- Actual experiences with customers and dev projects
- Research info from my blog at https://blog.q-bit.me/

Goals of these cheatsheets are

- to provide a basic, 1-page schedule for project bootstrapping
- listing up planning steps one should walk through before starting to code
- to serve as a reminder that one should `first solve the problem, then write the code`
